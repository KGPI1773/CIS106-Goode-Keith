CIS106 coursework
I am taking this course because I have a general interest in all things technology and programming. I have taken a few network courses here at Harper and have had fun completing them. I hope to learn a solid foundation in coding from this course. I hope to find how I can apply programming principles to my work in education and maybe even design a rudimentary app.
